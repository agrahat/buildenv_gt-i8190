This is the basic build env to edit and build the linux kernel for the Samsung GT-I8190.

Place the linux sources in 'kernel'.
Place the initramfs files in 'ramdisk-contents'.

You can import this folder into Eclipse CDT as a project.
It is a good idea to start eclipse with -vmargs -Xmx768.

With ./build_kernel.sh you can build the kernel, have look into the file for options.
